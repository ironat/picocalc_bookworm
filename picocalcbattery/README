Only tested with Bullseye!!

A LXpanel plugin which displays picocalcbattery in Panel.
This is written for Raspbian but should work on any Linux using LXpanel.

To install plugin on the Raspberry Pi run either (32 bit)

	sudo cp picocalcbattery.so /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lxpanel/plugins/picocalcbattery.so

or (64 bit)

    sudo cp picocalcbattery64.so /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/lxpanel/plugins/picocalcbattery.so

Either restart or run `lxpanelctl restart` to make LXDE aware it is installed.

execute compile.sh
```
>./compile.sh
```
